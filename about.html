        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2025, CRUXTAIN™ began as an intellectual and ontological overhead License, making distinction in intellectual properties both for public vs paid use of content(made by Cruxtain authors). The concept then branched out into being a creative logical generating system, oriented toward formulaic “truth” concepts. And now, it is both a home for publicly accessible philosophical writings “By CRUXTAIN authors“ posted on archive.Org and addons for Blender 3.6 or Upbge 3.6 soon to be sold on GumRoad.</p>
